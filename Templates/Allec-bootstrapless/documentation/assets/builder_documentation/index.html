    				<h3>1.1 Block Approach</h3>
    				
    				<p>
    					<span class="logo"><b class="text-primary">SITE</b>BUILDER <i>Lite</i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp; takes a block oriented approach to building web pages and web sites. What this is means is that <span class="logo">&nbsp;<b class="text-primary">SITE</b>BUILDER <i>Lite</i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp; provides the user with a selection of pre-designed blocks, such as headers, content sections, forms, footers, etc. which are combined onto a canvas to create fully functional web page.
    				</p>
    				
    				<p>
    					To have a look at blocks bundled with <span class="logo">&nbsp;<b class="text-primary">SITE</b>BUILDER <i>Lite</i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;, please have a look here: <a href="http://trybuilder.com/lite/#block" target="_blank">http://trybuilder.com/lite/#blocks</a>.

    					<span class="logo"><b class="text-primary">SITE</b>BUILDER <i>Lite</i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp; uses an easy to use and intuitive drag and drop interface. Use the left sidebar to select your blocks and drag them onto the canvas. Once dropped onto the canvas, blocks can easily be re-ordered using the same drag and drop functionality.

    					<span class="logo"><b class="text-primary">SITE</b>BUILDER <i>Lite</i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp; allows users to edit all written content within certain elements (as defined by the script's administrator). To edit written content, simply switch to "Content Mode" and hover over the element you'd like to edit. If the element's text is editable, a red dashed outline will appear around the element. After clicking the element, a modal popup window will appear in which you can edit the content.

    					<span class="logo"><b class="text-primary">SITE</b>BUILDER <i>Lite</i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp; allows users to edit images within blocks as well (please note that the application administrator can define which images are allowed to be edited, so it could be that not all images are ediatble).

    				<p>
    					<span class="logo"><b class="text-primary">SITE</b>BUILDER <i>Lite</i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp; makes a distinction between "<b>user images</b>" and "<b>other images</b>". User images are uploaded by users themselves and are stored in their image libraries. Other images have been uploaded the application administrator and can not be managed/removed by regular application users. When accessing your image library from the top menu, you will see two tabs, one for your own images and one for the other images.

    				<img src="img/pic4.png" alt="SiteBuilder picture">

    					The "Publish" button will bring up the publish window. Here, you can choose which assets and/or pages to publish. When you're publishing your site for the first time, you will want to choose ALL assets and ALL pages. After having published your site for the first time, you want to only publish those assets and pages which have been changed, as this will speed up the publication process significantly.

This feature allows administrators to pre-build pages which can be used by regular users. An admin user can build a page as he would with any other page, but instead of saving it as a regular site, he or she can choose to save the page as a template. Doing so, will make this template available for all regular users using the application. It's currently not possible to restrict access for certain users or to certain templates.

					<img src="img/pic32.png" alt="SiteBuilder picture">
					
					<p>
    					To use a template, the user simply drags and drops a template onto the canvas, as it was any other regular block. This will clear the canvas and drop all the blocks contained within the template on the canvas. After this, the user can then continue to work on the site as he or she would do normally.

						An admin user can edit a template by dragging it onto the canvas, making the desired changes and the save as template. To delete a template, simply click the red DEL button on top of the template you'd like to remove.

    				<p>
    					<span class="logo"><b class="text-primary">SITE</b>BUILDER <i>Lite</i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp; comes with an easy installation script, saving you from the trouble of having to everything manually.
    				</p>
    				
    				<p>
    					After downloading your copy from CodeCanyon, you'll need to start by unpacking the ZIP file on your computer. Next, upload the everything inside the <b>SITEBUILDER</b> to your webserver. Once done, open your browser and navigate to the <b>/install/</b> folder (for example, if you have uploaded the application to http://mydomain.com, you would need to open http://mydomain.com/install/ in your browser). This will bring up the installation script shown below:
    				</p>
    				
    				<img src="img/pic19.png" alt="SiteBuilder picture">
    				
    				<p>
    					Here you'll need to fill in your MySQL database connection details and the email address and password you want to assign to the first <b>admin</b> account in your application (you will login with these details once the installation has been completed).
    				</p>
    				
    				<p>
    					<b>Things to check after installation</b><br>
    					The first thing you should check are a couple of folder permissions. You'll need to make sure the following folders are writable by your webserver:
    				</p>
    				<ul>
    					<li>
    						/elements/images/uploads
    					</li>
    					<li>
    						/tmp
    					</li>
    				</ul>
    				
    				<p>
    					The next thing you should verify is that there is a file named "<b>.htaccess</b>" located in your application's root folder. Since this file is hidden, you might need to force your file viewer to show hidden files.

						<span class="logo"><b class="text-primary">SITE</b>BUILDER <i>Lite</i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp; v1.4.0 has seen a complete rewrite of the builder interface as well as major changed to the back-end code as well. Therefor, we suggest to do a complete re-install when switching to v1.4.0.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The syntax of the <b>elements.json</b> file has slightly changed. You're able to use your orignal <b>elements.json</b> file, but you'll need to make some small changes to it (you'll need to remove the variable declaration from the beginning of the file, please use the v1.4.0 elements.json as reference).
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The Javascript configuration is now done through a separate file located at <b>/js/sitebuilder/config.js</b>. To keep using your origial settings, you can copy the orignal <b>editableItems</b> and <b>editableItemOptions</b> arrays.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						All the CSS and Javascript used by the blocks is now minified and concatenated for faster load times. The CSS used by the application is concatenated and minified as well. When making changes to the application CSS, you'll need to run Grunt (Gruntfile.js is included in the root folder) to make sure the changes are reflected in the used CSS. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<b>Migrations</b><br>
						To make sure your database is completely up to date, as off v1.4.0 we're inlcuding CI Migrations to easily update your database. To perform the migration, follow the folllowing steps:
					</p>
					
					<ol>
						<li>
							Edit <b>/application/config/migration.php</b> and set "migration_enabled" to TRUE.
						</li>
						<li>
							Point your browser to "http://yourdomain.com/index.php/mirgate" where you obviously replace "yourdomain.com" with the domain to your copy of the application. This will run the migration and automatically update your database.
						</li>
						<li>
							Edit <b>/application/config/migration.php</b> and set "migration_enabled" to FALSE.

    				<p>
    					<span class="logo"><b class="text-primary">SITE</b>BUILDER <i>Lite</i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp; is translation ready. What this means is that all text used throughout the application is contained in language files. Language files are located in <b>/application/language/</b> and the default language is "English" (language files located in /application/language/english/).
    				</p>
    				
    				<p>
    					If you want to translate the application, you'll first need to create the required language files. You can do this by simply copying the English language files and place them in the proper directory. For example, if you're translating the application into Russian, you'll need to copy the language files to <b>/application/language/russian/</b>. Many language folders are already there, if yours is not there, you can just add it.
    				</p>
    				
    				<p>
    					After creating the language files, you'll need to change the application's language through the Settings panel.

    				<p>
    					<span class="logo"><b class="text-primary">SITE</b>BUILDER <i>Lite</i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp; allows you to easily extend the application by adding your own custom block! All that is required is some basic (basic, really) knowledge about HTML and Javascript. You can decide to either modify the existing blocks, add your own blocks or use nothing but your own blocks; it's all possible! In this section we'll explain how the blocks fit into the application and how to you can add your own!

    				<h3>3.2 Block Files</h3>
    				
    				<p>
    					The blocks used by the application are all placed within their own HTML file. This means that header 1, header 2, content section 1, etc all have their own HTML file. By default, these files are all located in <b>/elements</b>.
    				</p>
    				
    				<p>
    					Below you'll see the contents of a random block file (a contact form block bundled with the application). Please note that some of the deeper HTML has been collapsed to keep the file shorter and clearer.
    				</p>
    				
    				<img src="img/pic24.png" alt="SiteBuilder picture">
    				
    				<p>
    					In the <b>HEAD</b> section is used to include the required CSS files as well as some meta tags and other regular stuff you'll find in HTML document headers.
    				</p>
    				
    				<p>
    					The first child HTML element found in the <b>BODY</b> is an important element. The is the container element for your blocks and should be included in EVERY block file. The default ID for this element is "page", which you can usually leave as is. However if you want to change the ID of this element, you'll need to change this inside <b>/application/js/builder.js</b> as well. After you've changed the setting builder.js, you can use this ID for the container element in all your block files.
    				</p>

					<img src="img/pic25.png" alt="SiteBuilder picture">
										
					<p>
						Inside the main container element, you can place all the markup for this particular block. And towards the bottom, before the closing <b>BODY</b> tag, you can include the required Javascript files.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						To keep everything nice and neat, we suggest keeping all your CSS files, Javascript files and images within child folders of the <b>/elements/</b> folder.
					</p>
					
					<h3>Block files and SiteBuilder specific markup</h3>
					
					<p>
						<b>"editContent" class</b><br>
						To enable elements and sections as "content editable" (meaning users can edit the written content within these sections), you would need to add the class name "<b>editContent</b>". This class name can either be added to content elements (such H1, H2, H3, P, SPAN, A, etc) directly OR to elements containing multiple content elements (for example, a DIV containing several H1, H2 and P tags).
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<b>Youtube and Vimeo videos</b><br>
						To be able to edit Youtube and Vimeo videos, you will need to apply some specific markup. For starters, you will need to wrap the IFRAME in a DIV with class name "<b>videoWrapper</b>". Second, the containing DIV will need to contain another empty DIV with class name "<b>frameCover</b>".
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<b>Table wrapper</b><br>
						To make a table editable, you will need to wrap the entire table in a DIV with class name "<b>tableWrapper</b>".
					</p>

    			<div class="section" id="ce_elementsjson">
    			
    				<h3>3.3 elements.json</h3>
    				
    				<p>
    					Once you have your block files nice and ready, the next step involves editing the file <b>/elements.json</b>. This JSON file contains links to all your block files as well as some additional data. As the file extension suggests, the data format is JSON. If you're not familiar with JSON, <a href="http://json.org" target="_blank">please have a quick look at this website</a>. Even without much understanding of the JSON format, editing the elements.json file is still pretty easy, just have a look at how the file is structured and you should be ok.
    				</p>
    				
    				<p>
    					As you can see, the blocks in the file are organised by category. This same structure is used to organise your blocks in the left sidebar in the drag and drop builder. Furthermore, for each block the file contains the <b>URL</b>, the <b>height</b> and the <b>thumbnail link</b>. The thumbnail link is optional, if left out, a iframe thumbnail will be used (please keep in mind that when you leave the thumbnail link out for many blocks, the load speed of the application can get a lot slower).
    				</p>

    			<div class="section" id="ce_skeletonhtml">
    			
    				<h3>3.4 skeleton.html</h3>
    				
    				<p>
    					Once you have your block files ready and have successfully configured your /elements.json file, it's now time to configure the next piece of the puzzle: the skeleton file! The skeleton file is located at <b>/elements/skeleton.html</b> and serves as a skeleton or shell in/around which your pages will be build. When using the <a href="#export">export</a> or <a href="#publishing">publishing</a> functions, the pages you have build on the canvas are placed within the skeleton file before being zipped or published on your webserver.
    				</p>
    				
    				<p>
    					Since the skeleton.html file is used to create all your pages, it has certain requirements:
    				</p>
    				
    				<img src="img/pic26.png" alt="SiteBuilder picture">
    				
    				<p>
    					In the <b>HEAD</b> section, you will need to include ALL the CSS files used by ANY of your blocks. Since any of your blocks can end up in the skeleton file, the CSS files need to be there as well.
    				</p>
    				
    				<p>
    					Next, you will need to include the container element as the first child element of the <b>BODY</b> section. This element needs to be EMPTY (like in the screenshot above).
    				</p>
    				
    				<p>
    					Finally, before the closing <b>BODY</b> tag, you'll need to include ALL of your Javascript files used by ANY of your blocks. Same story as with the CSS, any of your blocks can end up in this skeleton file, so all Javascript files need to referenced from this file.
    				</p>

    				<h3>3.5 Editable Items</h3>
    				
    				<p>
    					It's up to the applications administrators to define which HTML elements are editable and for each for each of those elements, which CSS properties can be edited by the end-users.
    				</p>
    				
    				<p>
    					This configuration takes place in the file <b>/js/builder.js</b>.
    				</p>
    				
    				<img src="img/pic27.png" alt="SiteBuilder picture">
    				
    				<p>
    					As you can see from the screenshot above, the configuration takes the form of a Javascript array named "<b>editableItems</b>". Each key in this array represents a <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/" target="_blank">jQuery selector</a> and the value belonging to that key holds another array containing the editable properties for that jQuery selector.
    				</p>
    				
    				<p>
    					The second array that's important here is called "<b>editableItemOptions</b>". In this array, you can specify options the user can choose from when editing that particular property. If none are specified, the user will see a regular text field in which they can enter any value.
    				</p>
    				
    				<p>
    					<b>Please note that any properties in the <b>editableItems</b> array containing the word "color" will automatically launch a color picker when the user tries to the change that property.</b>
    				</p>
    				
    				<p>
    					<b>Editable text</b><br>
    					With version 1.1, an improved way of editing written text was introduced. The new method is using a (rich) text editor rather then relying on "designMode". The new method requires editable sections to be defined in "/js/builder.js" using the "editableContent" array. This array should hold a selection of proper jQuery selectors, pointing to elements which text contents are editable. You can either enter individual elements, or grouped together. When using grouped elements, it's advised to wrap those elements in a containing <b>DIV</b> and place a jQuery selector for this <b>DIV</b> in the "editableContent" array.

    				<img src="img/pic28.png" alt="SiteBuilder picture">

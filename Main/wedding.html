                <small>
                    Jimmy and Katelyn fell in love when they were fifteen years old. He was a football player and she was a cheerleader. They met at an athletic event at their high school in 2008 and have been inseparable ever since. Jimmy went to college at Virginia Tech and Katelyn went to James Madison University. Even 140 miles apart, their love and commitment to each other never wavered. Jimmy proposed in September 2015 on the football field at their high school, right where they first met. They chose to get married at the Woman's Club of Portsmouth, where Katelyn's parents had their wedding reception 26 years earlier.

                <b>Eight Hours of Coverage – </b>This refers to the amount of time that is spent by our cinema team on location on any aspect of recording/ capturing media. Our team will capture the best possible video and audio throughout the time we are on location to make your wedding day that much more memorable. We find that eight hours is the amount of time that it takes for us to best capture the days events. You can request extra hours past the agreed upon coverage duration once we get verbal agreement the day of the wedding. We are happy to stay longer if you let us know.

                <b>Cinema Team – </b>Depending on your wedding, we will have either one or two shooters at your wedding. We will be sure to capture your day from multiple angles and cameras, and produce high quality material to be used in your film. I (Tim Felbinger) act as the director of our cinema team on your wedding day and will also be the one editing your film. Same Day Film – The same day film is a 1-minute film that is finished before your wedding day is over. This film is great for sharing your wedding day with all of your friends and family (even those who could not attend).
